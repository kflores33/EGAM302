    story: Once upon a time, on a warm spring day, an evil dragon attacked a palace.
      He killed the royal family, the palace guard, and even the court jester, just
      because he felt like it. Satisfied with his work, the dragon settled down for
      a nap in the throne room, and it was then that a little girl walked in, holding
      a sword. She shook the dragon awake.

    story: "She asked, \"Could you tell me where the king is, please? I have to kill
      him.\" Rather taken back, the dragon replies, \"I\u2019ve already eaten him.\"
      Hearing this, the little girl bow politely and said \"Thank you very much!\"
      Puzzled by her appreciation, the dragon asked, \"Why do you thank me, little
      girl?\""

    story: "The girl replied, \"The king you ate was not the true king. My dead mummy
      told me that he took the palace from my daddy. That\u2019s why I had to kill
      him \u2013 to get my palace back!\" The little girl wasn\u2019t lying either.
      She really was the rightful heir to the throne."

    story: "The girl continued, \"Now I\u2019m Queen, I\u2019m going to kill all
      the people who let my daddy die!\" The dragon laughed and said,\" Very well,
      little Queen. Then I shall bestow my power upon you and your sword.\" So they
      exchanged their beating hearts. Then the little girl took her sword, slaughtered
      everyone, and lived happily ever after."
